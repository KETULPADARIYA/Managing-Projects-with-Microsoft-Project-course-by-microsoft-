As I get ready to launch your new project, I realize that I might need to team up with another company, to fill any gaps that Trey Research may have. I have found an existing Trey project that contains the tasks and resources to merge with or acquire another company, and I would like to modify this project plan for your use. I know that you can save it as a template, and then create a new project from the template and make the necessary changes to suit your needs. The steps to create the template are simple.

1. Open the project plan that you want to save as a template.
	a Open the Merger_and_Acquisitions_Analysis.mpp project plan from the 	  location where it has been saved.
2. Save the project plan as a template.
	a Use the Save As command to save the file as a Project Template, with 	  the .mpt extension, to the location where you want it to be saved.
3. Select the data that you like to keep or remove from the template.
   Note: The Mergers and Acquisitions Analysis project is in progress, and it is    important to remove any data that will not be used in a new project that will    be created based upon the template.

	a. In the Save As Template dialog box, check the Values of all baselines            and Actual Values options.
	b. Leave the remaining values unchecked.
	c. Click Save.
4. Close the template file.
